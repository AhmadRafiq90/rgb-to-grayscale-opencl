# RGB to Grayscale Converter (OpenCL)  

## Overview  
This project converts RGB images to grayscale using an OpenCL kernel for parallel processing. By leveraging GPU acceleration, it provides a highly efficient solution for large image datasets.  

## Features  
- Uses OpenCL to perform fast image processing  
- Supports high-resolution images  
- Efficient memory management for optimal performance  
- Works on both CPU and GPU (depending on OpenCL device availability)  

## Prerequisites  
Ensure you have the following installed before running the project:  
- OpenCL SDK (Intel, AMD, or NVIDIA)  
- C++ compiler with OpenCL support  
- OpenCV (for image handling)  

## Installation  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RGB-to-Grayscale-OpenCL.git
   cd RGB-to-Grayscale-OpenCL
   ```  
2. Install dependencies (if not already installed):  
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ocl-icd-opencl-dev opencl-headers libopencv-dev
   ```  
   *(For Windows, ensure OpenCL drivers are installed from your GPU vendor.)*  

3. Compile the project:  
   ```bash
   g++ -o grayscale_converter main.cpp -lOpenCL `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv4`
   ```  

## Usage  
Run the program with an input image:  
```bash
./grayscale_converter input.jpg output.jpg
```  

## OpenCL Kernel  
The OpenCL kernel processes each pixel in parallel, using the formula:  
\[
\text{Gray} = 0.299R + 0.587G + 0.114B
\]  
This ensures a perceptually accurate grayscale conversion.  

## Performance  
Compared to CPU-based conversion, this OpenCL implementation significantly reduces processing time, especially for high-resolution images.
